# Full Stack E-Commerce + Dashboard & CMS using React & Next.js (Admin)

The repository for my Full Stack E-Commerce website, I created this project following this [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5miHyP6lExg), but with my own little tweaks such as responsive Admin page.

Features:

* Admin dashboard is going to serve as both CMS, Admin and API
* You will be able to control mulitple vendors / stores through this single CMS! (For example you can have a "Shoe store" and a "Laptop store" and a "Suit store", and our CMS will generate API routes for all of those individually)
* You will be able to create, update and delete categories
* You will be able to create, update and delete products
* You will be able to upload multiple images for products, and change them whenever you want
* You will be able to create, update and delete filters such as "Color" and "Size", and then match them in the "Product" creation form
* You will be able to create, update and delete "Billboards" which are these big texts on top of the page. You will be able to attach them to a single category, or use them standalone (Our Admin generates API for all of those cases)
* You will be able to Search through all categories, products, sizes, colors, billboards with included pagination
* You will be able to control which products are "featured" so they show on the homepage
* You will be able to see your orders, sales, etc
* You will be able to see graphs of your revenue etc
* Clerk Authentication
* Order creation
* Stripe checkout
* Stripe webhooks
* MySQL + Prisma + PlanetScale
